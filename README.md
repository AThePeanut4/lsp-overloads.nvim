# LSP Overloads Nvim

Extends the built-in Neovim LSP signature helper handler to add additional functionality, focussing on enhancements
for method overloads.

## Rationale

- Native LSP signatureHelper handler doesn't provide an easy way to view all the possible overloads and parameter details for signatures
- Other Neovim LSP plugins either don't support method overloads in the signatureHelper popup view, or don't focus specifically on method overloads
and are therefore lacking in the functionality I wanted from handling multiple signatures

## Requirements

- Neovim â‰¥ 0.7.0

## Installation

Install the plugin with the package manager of choice:

```lua
--Packer
use { 'Issafalcon/lsp-overloads.nvim'}
```

## Configuration

Within your custom `on-attach` function that you provide as part of the options to the LSP server, setup the plugin, which will override 
the built-in `signatureHelper` LSP handler:

<p>
<details>
<summary style='cursor: pointer'><b>Example without option overrides</b></summary>

```lua
  --- Guard against servers without the signatureHelper capability
  if client.server_capabilities.signatureHelpProvider then
    require('lsp-overloads').setup(client, { })
  end
```

</details>
</p>

<p>
<details>
<summary style='cursor: pointer'><b>Example with option overrides (defaults shown)</b></summary>

```lua
  --- Guard against servers without the signatureHelper capability
  if client.server_capabilities.signatureHelpProvider then
    require('lsp-overloads').setup(client, {
        -- UI options are mostly the same as those passed to vim.lsp.util.open_floating_preview
        ui = {
          border = "single"           -- The border to use for the signature popup window. Accepts same border values as |nvim_open_win()|.
          height = nil,               -- Height of the signature popup window (nil allows dynamic sizing based on content of the help)
          width = nil,                -- Width of the signature popup window (nil allows dynamic sizing based on content of the help)
          wrap = true,                -- Wrap long lines
          wrap_at = nil,              -- Character to wrap at for computing height when wrap enabled
          max_width = nil,            -- Maximum signature popup width
          max_height = nil,           -- Maximum signature popup height
          -- Events that will close the signature popup window: use {"CursorMoved", "CursorMovedI", "InsertCharPre"} to hide the window when typing
          close_events = { "CursorMoved", "BufHidden", "InsertLeave" },
          focusable = true,           -- Make the popup float focusable
          focus = false,              -- If focusable is also true, and this is set to true, navigating through overloads will focus into the popup window (probably not what you want)
          offset_x = 0,               -- Horizontal offset of the floating window relative to the cursor position
          offset_y = 0                -- Vertical offset of the floating window relative to the cursor position
          floating_window_above_cur_line = false -- Attempt to float the popup above the cursor position 
                                                 -- (note, if the height of the float would be greater than the space left above the cursor, it will default 
                                                 -- to placing the float below the cursor. The max_height option allows for finer tuning of this)
        },
        keymaps = {
          next_signature = "<C-j>",
          previous_signature = "<C-k>",
          next_parameter = "<C-l>",
          previous_parameter = "<C-h>",
        },
        display_automatically = true --enables the automatic display feature alternativelly you can manually request with LspOverloadsSignature
      })
  end
```

## Usage

LSP trigger characters will cause the signature popup to be displayed. If there are any overloads, the popup will indicate this is the case and
you will be able to navigate between the overloads.

Regardless of whether or not overloads exist, you will also be able to navigate between the parameters which will change the content of the signature popup to display
the details of the highlighted parameter.

### Triggering Signature Overload and Parameters

To trigger the lsp-overloads signature popup manually when in normal mode, you can create the following mapping, as an example:
```
  vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("n", "<A-s>", ":LspOverloadsSignature<CR>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
```
To instead toggle the display on and off, you can use 
```
:LspOverloadsSignatureDisplayToggle
```

#### Toggling automatic display
lsp-verloads automatically shows itself by default when you are inside of a function signature and begin typing.
You can toggle this feature using 
```
:LspOverloadsSignatureAutoToggle
```
You can disable lsp-overloads by default by setting 'display_automatically' to false as part of the config.


### Keybinds
The default mappings are used to navigate between various signature overloads and parameters when the signature popup is displayed:
- `next_signature = "<C-j>"`
- `previous_signature = "<C-k>"`
- `next_parameter = "<C-l>"`
- `previous_parameter = "<C-h>"`

### Additional Tips

- Any calls to `vim.lsp.buf.signature_help()` made while the plugin's signature popup is displayed, will behave
in the same way as the built-in signature popup (i.e. When `focusable` set to true Cursor will enter the popup in normal mode, allowing scrolling behaviour)
